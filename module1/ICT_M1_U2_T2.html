            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <strong>A computer system consists of hardware and software components.</strong> As important as the software which are the programs that run the computer, the <strong>hardware</strong> is the physical equipment such as the case, storage drives, keyboards, monitors, cables, speakers, and printers that builds up and let the software run. <br><br>
                It is important to learn about these components as these will be the basis before you handle equipment especially in disassembling and assembling a computer system.

            <p>The motherboard is also known as <strong>mainboard, system board, logic board, </strong>or <strong>MOBO.</strong> It holds and allows communication between the crucial components of the computer such as the CPU and memory. It also provides connection for other peripherals. This provides the path which the processor (CPU) communicates with all the components of the computer.</p>
                <img src="images/img45.png" alt="img45">

                    <p>There are several components that are attached to the motherboard. These include:</p>
                        <ol>

            <h3 style="text-align: start;"><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong></h3>
            <p>Commonly known as the <strong>CPU</strong> or <strong>processor,</strong> this is the brain of the computer. It interprets and carries out the basic instructions to operate a computer. </p><br>
            <p>It impacts overall computing power and manages most of the computer operations. The motherboard contains a socket to hold the processor or CPU. The central processing unit <strong>(CPU),</strong>also called the processor or microprocessor, does most of the processing of data and instructions for the entire system. Because the CPU generates heat, a fan and heat sink might be installed on top to keep it cool.</p><br>
            <p>Nowadays, processors have multiple cores called <strong>multi-core processors.</strong>This means that the processor is a single chip that has two or more separate processors. In multi-core processors, each of the processors run at a slower clock speed as compared to a single-core processor, but this efficient process typically increases performance. There are two kinds of common multi-core processors today:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dual Core Processor</strong> - chip that contains two separate processors</li>
                <li><strong>Quad Core Processor</strong> - chip with four separate processors</li>
            </ol>

                <p><strong>AMD</strong> and <strong>Intel</strong>are the two most popular brands of processors in the market nowadays.</p>
                <p>Bundled with the processors are the heat sinks.  A <strong>heat sink</strong>consists of metal fins that draw heat away from a component. The fan and heat sink together are called the processor cooler. The photo below shows a CPU with a heat sink mounted on the motherboard.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: start;"><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong></h3>
                <p>The <strong>Random Access Memory</strong> or <strong>RAM</strong> acts as temporary storage as long as the computer is running. The contents of the RAM change as programs are executed. These are chips that are placed directly on the motherboard. These RAM consists of switches which are triggered by changes in electric current. </p>

                    <li><strong>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</strong> - This kind of RAM needs to be recharged by the CPU. If not, it loses its contents. There are many variations of DRAM such as:
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                            <li><strong>Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)</strong> – faster than DRAM because it is synchronized to the system clock</li>
                            <li><strong>Double Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM</strong> – faster than SDRAM because they transfer data twice for each clock cycle</li>
                            <li><strong>DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM</strong> – faster than DDR SDRAM</li>
                            <li><strong>d.	ambus DRAM (RDRAM)</strong> – type of DRAM faster than SDRAM that uses pipelining techniques</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Static RAM (SRAM)</strong> – This kind is faster and more reliable than any form of DRAM. Unlike the DRAM, this does not need to be re-energized. However, it is much more expensive, and it used for special purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM)</strong> – This kind stores data using magnetic charges instead of electrical charges. It has greater storage capacity, consume less power, and faster access times.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/img53.png" alt="img53">
                    <p>The RAM chips are housed in a small circuit board called the <strong>memory module,</strong> which is inserted into the motherboard.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM)</strong> – this has pins on opposite sides of the circuit board which connect to form a single set of contacts. This houses SDRAM chips along with DIMMs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)</strong> – the pins on the opposite sides of the circuit board do not connect and form two sets of contacts. This houses SDRAM chips along with SIMMs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rambus Inline Memory Module (RIMM) </strong>– this houses RDRAM chips</li>

                    The computer will need a certain amount of memory to be able to handle programs, data, and information, depending on the types of applications used. <br>
                    The more RAM a computer has, the faster the computer will be. <br>
                    To be able to use basic application software such as Office Suite, one needs at least 1GB of RAM. <br>
                    Using programs and multimedia should have at least 4GB. <br>
                    Playing modern games or using editing software will require at least 8GB. <br>
                    Today the RAM ranges up to 64GB depending on the programs that will be used for the computer.

            <h3 style="text-align: start;"><strong>Cooling Technology</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Cooling technologies </strong>are essential in avoiding the computer from overheating and maintaining a good, well-ventilated system.</p>
            <img src="images/img55.png" alt="img55">
            <p><i>Chassis Fan</i><br>
                Several cooling technologies are present throughout the system unit:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fans </strong>are also present in several components such as the power supply, ports, processor, hard disk etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat sink, </strong>on another hand, is a small metal or ceramic component with fins on the surface which absorbs and distributes heat produced by electrical components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat pipe </strong>is used on smaller devices like notebook computers since this is smaller in size.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 style="text-align: start;"><strong>Expansion Cards</strong></h3>
            <p>A motherboard has expansion slots to be used by expansion cards. An <strong>expansion card,</strong>also called an <strong>adapter card,</strong> is a circuit board that provides more ports than those provided by the motherboard. </p>
            <p>The photo below shows a <strong>Video Card</strong>, where it provides three video ports. Notice the cooling fan and heat sink on the card, which help to keep the card from overheating. The trend today is for most ports in a system to be provided by the motherboard (called onboard ports) and less use of expansion cards.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: start;"><strong>Expansion Cards</strong></h3>
                <p>A system might have one or more hard drives, an optical drive, a tape drive, or, for old systems, a floppy drive. <br>
                A <strong>hard drive</strong>, also called a <strong>hard disk drive (HDD)</strong>, is permanent storage used to hold data and programs.  </p>

                <h5><i>Heat Sink</i></h5>
                <p>For example, the Windows operating system and applications are installed on the hard drive. All drives in a system are installed in a stack of drive bays at either the front or on the lower portion of the case.  Nowadays, users use Solid State Drive or SSDs because of its use of flash memory, which does not use physical disks to write memory/data.</p>

                    <h5><i>Solid State Drive</i></h5>
                    <p>Each drive has two connections for cables: the power cable connects to the power supply and another cable, used for data and instructions, connects to the motherboard.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: start;"><strong>Ports, Sockets, Slots,& Connectors</strong></h3>
                <p>The motherboard has several ports, sockets, slots, and connectors that link the computers' components, input, and output devices among each other. First, we'll look at the port which are usually found at the side of the motherboard or the back of the system case.</p><br><br>
                <p><i>The port basically serves as an interface between the computer and other computers or peripheral devices.</i></p>
                <p>A <strong>port</strong> generally refers to the female part of connection. Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other peripheral devices. <br>
                    On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a plug or cable connects. Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals between devices.
                    </p>
                <dt>Familiarize yourself with the following ports usually found with computer systems below:</dt>

            <h3 style="text-align: start;"><strong>Sockets</strong></h3>
                <p><i>The following are the most common sockets found in the motherboard. The CPU socket where the CPU itself is inserted and the CMOS slot where the CMOS battery (which lets the motherboard remember the date and time of the computer) that is replaced after it has worn out.</i></p>
