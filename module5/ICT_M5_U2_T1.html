            <h1 style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we are looking at how we are going to diagnose faults that we may find in the computer systems. We may need to identify and isolate these issues especially when the hardware that is having a problem is hard to identify.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is an <strong>essential skill</strong> especially when we are troubleshooting computers where the user does not know exactly what went wrong.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Identifying and Isolating Faults</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The following are the <strong>different ways to diagnose a computer system problem.</strong> Make sure to familiarize yourself with these as you will be making use of these when others would not work.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <dt><strong>Power On Self Test (POST)</strong> </dt>
                            <dd>
                                This stands for Power On Self Test. After turning on the computer’s power, this will be the first screen that will appear before the operating system loads. The POST will display any problems found in the hardware that prevents the computer to boot or not operate in its full capacity during operation.
                            </dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt><strong>Operating System Load Time</strong> </dt>
                            <dd>
                                If the operating system takes to load than usual, there may be errors in the hard drive.
                            </dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt><strong>Graphic Problems </strong> </dt>
                            <dd>
                                Check whether the computer graphics are good after the operating system loads. Reduced graphics may indicate that there are hardware failures with the graphic cards.
                            </dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt><strong>Perform an auditory test </strong> </dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>
                                    Play a short audio clip. When the audio is lagging, it means that the processor is working at an elevated speed. It could also mean that there is no longer enough RAM to keep programs loading. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Changing the startup sound is a great way to apply this test. Another issue associated with choppy sounds is PIO (Programmed Input/Output) Mode. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This affects how the hard drive reads and writes data from a drive. Switching to DMA allows for faster reads and writes and can sometimes repair choppy audio.
                                </p>
                            </dd>

                                    Most operating system, especially Windows, can experience conflict with new drivers. However, Windows would usually notify you about drivers that may be causing the issue. This can be checked through Windows Device Manager.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Use this to check and arrange hardware properties.

                                    New software requires more resources than the system provides. If problem occurs after the software starts, it is most likely caused by the software.
                                </p>

                                    This is the most common cause of why a computer lag. Check the computer’s Task Manager, click 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Should this occur, turn off the computer and diagnose the harddrive. If the CPU fan comes off at high speed when the CPU is working hard, it means that the computer is working hard beyond its capacity. 
                                </p>

                                    Third party software applications can be used.

                                    Safe mode can be activated by repeatedly tapping F8 during POST. If the issue still occurs even while still in safe mode, then it is an issue of the operating system.

                            For example, a network card with a solid green LED light indicates that the card is connected and can receive the signal. If the green light is flashing, it means that data is being sent or received.

                            Most home routers have a gateway address that starts with 192.168 like the address shown above.

                            <li>Turn off the computer and leave it off for a few minutes.</li>
                            <li>Unplug the power to your router and cable modem or DSL modem.</li>
                            <li>Leave the power cables disconnected for 1- to 15 seconds then plug in the modem and router again.</li>
                            <li>Finally, turn the computer again and repeat this step to see if the router can be pinged.</li>

                        If possible, disable the firewall to make sure that the firewall is not causing network problems. If the computer still utilizes the firewall, make sure that the required ports are open especially the HTTP port.

                <h4>Internet is not working.</h4>
                    <p>If you are still able to ping the router, but you still cannot connect to the Internet, it’s either the router is improperly configured, or the ISP is having issues.</p>

                    <p>
                        Running the command will get a reply from Google. If you get a reply, this means that the computer is working, if not, there may be a problem with the Internet browser because your router or modem is not reaching the Internet.

                    <p>
                        Try using other browsers such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. If you have a router, make sure that DHCP is enabled and that the WAN or Gateway address is the proper ISP address.

                    <p>
                        If problems still occur, contact the ISP to make sure that the problem is not on their end and if they could assist you to other special configurations.

                <h4>Additional troubleshooting   </h4>
                    <p>
                        Another method of determining network issues is to use the tracert command. It is the command prompt command that is used to show several details about the path that a packet takes from the computer or device you are on to whatever destination you specify. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It gives an overview of each device a packet travels over a network and gives an idea where a problem exists in or outside your network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To use this command, you must be at the command line and type one of the below commands depending on your operating system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        tracert google.com <br>
                        or <br>
                        traceroute google.com
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If run successfully you should begin to see each hop between the computer and network devices. When the connection fails, determine what device is causing the issue by reviewing the traceroute listing.
