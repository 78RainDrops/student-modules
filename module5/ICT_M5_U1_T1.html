            <h1 style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>Troubleshooting is an approach to locate the cause of faults in a computer system. Not all troubleshooting experiences are the same since technicians acquire this skill based on their knowledge and personal experience. </p>
                <p>
                    That is why as a computer technician, you must be <strong>knowledgeable</strong> in the <strong><i>fundamentals of the computer concepts</i></strong> since your approach to solving a problem may rely heavily on your own knowledge.
                </p>
        </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Preventive Maintenance</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    <strong>Preventive maintenance</strong> is the regular and systematic inspection, cleaning, and replacement of worn parts, materials, and systems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is done to <strong>prevent</strong> failure of parts, materials, and systems by regularly checking whether all parts are in good working order.
                </p>

                <h4><u>Purpose of Preventive Maintenance</u></h4>
                    <p>
                        Preventive maintenance reduces the probability of hardware or software problems by systematically and periodically checking hardware and software to ensure proper operation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regular preventive maintenance ensures minimal system failure. When there are fewer failures, less troubleshooting will be done, thus, saving an organization time and money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Preventive maintenance can also be done by upgrading certain hardware or software such as a hard drive that is making a noise, upgrading insufficient memory, and installing new software updates for security and reliability.
                    </p>
            </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conducting Maintenance</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    First and foremost, maintenance is important in <strong>reducing hardware and software issues.</strong> With this, computer downtime and repair costs are reduced. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Preventive maintenance <strong><i>depends on the needs and specifications of the equipment.</i></strong> For example, a device exposed to a dusty environment such as a construction site would need more maintenance as compared to an office environment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>High traffic networks</i> such as those used in schools would <strong>require more extensive scanning</strong> and removal of malicious software and unwanted files. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do take note that it is important to create documentation for any type of preventive maintenance, so that you can also check how often do certain hardware and software issues occur.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <caption>Besides these, here are more <strong>reasons why maintenance should be conducted:</strong></caption>
                    <li>Increased data protection</li>
                    <li>Extended device life</li>
                    <li>Increased equipment stability</li>
                    <li>Reduced repair costs</li>
                    <li>Reduced equipment failure.</li>

                <p style="border: 1px solid; width: 100%;"></p>
                <p>
                    Regular cleaning of components should also be done to reduce overheating. Replacement of damaged components due to excessive wear should also be conducted.

                <p>
                    Although <strong><u>troubleshooting</u></strong> varies and can be modified depending on case and experience, it requires an <strong><i>organized and logical approach</i></strong> when handling computers and components. Doing so will ensure that the process is in systematic order. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure to ask the right questions, test the right hardware, and examine the correct data to detect the issues and resolve them.
