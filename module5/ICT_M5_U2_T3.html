            <h1 style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we are looking at the different testing and method procedures when we are assessing and inspecting computer systems and networks. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing how to handle and maintain components is an essential step. Your job as a computer technician does not end with just assembling or connecting a network - it extends as well to make equipment stable for use for efficiency.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Testing the Hard Drive</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h4>A bad hard drive can cause more issues to your computer. </h4>
                    <p>
                        The following steps will ensure that hard drive errors can be addressed before it makes serious damages to the unit itself. Take note that the following issues can be caused by a much bigger issue other than a bad disk drive such as:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Errors when reading, copying, moving, or deleting data on the computer</li>
                        <li>Extremely slow system.</li>
                        <li>Operating system unable to boot.</li>
                        <li>Random error or computer randomly boots</li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Software Solutions</h4>
                    <p>The following shows a list of software programs that can be used to test the computer’s hard drive for errors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scandisk</li>
                        <li>Chkdsk</li>
                        <li>Testdisk</li>
                        <li>Hitachi Drive Fitness Test (DFT)</li>
                        <li>Seagate Sea Tools</li>
                        <li>HDD Health</li>
                        <li>Ultimate Boot CD</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Replacing the Hard Drive</h4>
                    <p>
                        If the hard drive is bad or is generating SMART error (A S.M.A.R.T. error is a predictive indicator that there will be a drive failure.) If you get a S.M.A.R.T. error, it means that you have to back-up since you would need to replace the hard drive soon. If the computer is relatively new, the hard drive may still come under a warranty.
                    </p>
            </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Testing the Power Supply Unit</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Some programs such as SpeedFan can help monitor the voltage and power supply to computer fans; however, there is no software utility to test the integrity of computer power supplies. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>It is recommended to replace the Computer Power Supply if it is no longer usable.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    It is also wise to check how much wattage your computer really requires. You can do this online at a PSU Wattage Calculator. This is to provide a more efficient electricity usage when checking your PSU.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Testing the Memory</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The following are some indicators that your computer’s memory may already be bad:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The computer does not boot, and a beeping sound is hear. </li>
                    <li>There are random computer crashes causing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), General Protection Fault Error Messages, Illegal Operations, Fatal Exceptions, etc.</li>
                    <li>Computer randomly reboots</li>
                    <li>Windows or other program installation failure.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><i>Take note that before testing your memory, make sure that you have removed recently added new memory to make sure that it is not the cause of the issue.</i></p>

                <h4>Software Solutions</h4>
                    <p>Several software programs are available to test computer hardware, including computer memory. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                    <p>
                        If there is an available compatible memory from another computer, you can try swapping the memory into the computer to check whether it is the issue. <br>
                        If the memory works in another computer without any issues, there may be a problem with the motherboard, PSU, or other hardware issue. 
                    </p>
                <h4>Replace Memory</h4>
                    <p>
                        If computer memory is completely bad already, replace it with a new one.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Testing the Motherboard and CPU</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h4>A bad computer motherboard or CPU can cause different issues on a computer. </h4>
                <p>
                    Below are some of the issues that you may encounter due to a computer with bad motherboard and CPU:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The computer does not boot, but instead gives a beep code.</li>
                    <li>The computer randomly crashes causing General Protection Fault error messages, illegal operations, Fatal exceptions, etc.</li>
                    <li>The computer suddenly reboots.</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="border: 1px solid; width: 100%;"></p>
                <p>
                    Here are some recommendations to test the computer’s motherboard and CPU:
                </p>
                <h4>Visual Hardware Check</h4>
                <p>
                    Check the computer motherboard if there is a presence of bulged or blown capacitors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Check if there is a slight bulge on the top of each capacitor. If the capacitor is leaking, it can be an indicator that it has already blown. Blown capacitors are likely caused by motherboard issues in the computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the CPU is removed, check for bent pins on the side that are inserted into the motherboard. If there is a bent pin, it is most likely the cause of the computer’s CPU issues. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is possible to replace a blown or bulging capacitor, but it will require precision soldering to install the capacitor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bent pins on a CPU can be bent back into place, but make sure to be very careful because the pin might break off when trying to bend it back into place. If the pin breaks off, the CPU will need to be replaced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are done with the visual hardware check and there seems to be no obvious issues, there may be an issue with the software.
                </p>
                <h4>Software and Hardware Solutions</h4>
                <p>Here are some software programs that you can use to test your computer’s motherboard and CPU. However, take note that problems related to the motherboard and CPU have a wide variety of complexity; thus, these programs may not detect every possible failure.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hot CPU Tester </strong>– This tester includes a burn-in feature for new computers or computers with new motherboard or CPU.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool </strong>– This can be used for computers running on Intel processor. It is a free utility for testing a variety of Intel processors.</li>
                        <li><strong>PC-doctor </strong>– A good, but quite pricey software used by service centers and technicians to diagnose computer hardware issues including motherboard issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ultra-X </strong>– A collection of products that can be used to test computer hardware, including the motherboard.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Replacing the Motherboard and CPU</h4>
                    <p>
                        After you are done with the visual hardware check and software/hardware check and it was determined that one or both can no longer be used, then it is already time to replace the motherboard and the CPU. There is typically no easier or cheaper alternative to fixing the motherboard or the CPU.

                <p>
                    Before testing this, make sure that multiple discs do not work in the drive. If only one CD or DVD is causing the problem, consider that it can be an issue with the CD and not the CD/DVD drives.
                </p>
                <p>A bad disc drive can cause a variety of issues to your computer. Here are some issues that are caused by a bad drive:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Errors when reading CD or DVD.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>
                    Here are some recommendations to test your computer’s CD ROM and DVD drive:
                </p>
                <h4>Software and Hardware Solutions</h4>
                    <p>The most common issue that CD ROMs and DVD drives is caused bu dust and dirt making it unable for the drives to read discs. You can use a CD/DVD Drive Cleaner kit to help clean the disc drive. These can be purchased in many offices supply stores and electronic stores. Some software tools that can be used are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CD Roller </strong>– Program that can be used to rest CD/DVD drivers as well as recover data from CDs and DVDs</li>

                <p><i>Here are some steps that you can do to check your computer connection:</i></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Check physical connections</h4>
                            <p>Check whether the little red or green light next to the RJ-45 port is lit on every computer. Check this light both on the computer itself and on the switch or router the computer is plugged into. </p>
                            <p>If the light is not on, you may have a connection problem—most likely a poorly connected cable.</p>

                            <p>You can try using the ping command from the command prompt to make sure that all computers on the network can contact one another. Make sure that the TCP/IP is up and running by having the computer ping itself. Launch the Command Prompt and type ping localhost. The prompt will indicate whether the ping was successful.</p>
