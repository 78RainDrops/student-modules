            <p style="text-align: justify;">When you open a computer, usually this will either be a Windows PC or a Macintosh computer. They will have different user interfaces or applications that may be specific to that computer. The Windows or the Mac are called <i>operating systems</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>The <strong>Operating System (OS)</strong> is a layer of software which is used to manage computer resources. It also provides an interface, so that users can utilize computer resources. It configures and manages hardware to connect the components and the applications.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Different Operating Systems</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The three most popular operating systems are <strong>Windows, MAC,</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>.

            <p>	Windows is the dominant over the other two. 90% of computer users use Windows operating system. <br>
                Windows and MAC are expensive operating systems however, MAC OS requires the users to buy the MAC systems (Macbook, Mac) built by Apple. <br>
                On the other hand, Linux is a free operating system.<br>
                Windows and MAC have similar file structures while Linux has a different code base (single file tree compared to Windows and MAC's many directories)<br>
                Windows interface has a Start menu, Taskbar, System Tray, and the Windows Explore while Linux has easy to switch interfaces.<br>
                Linux is most preferred by programmers, MAC is preferred by graphic artists, and Windows is preferred by gamers.<br>

            <h3>Common Operating Systems</h3>
            <caption>The following are common operating systems being used today:</caption>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Installing Device Drivers</u></h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This is an essential step that you need to be aware of after installing an operating system. Basically, the device drivers tell your operating system how to use the components like the motherboard, graphics card, network interface cards, sound cards, and other devices. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="border: 1px solid; width: 100%;"></p>
            <p>Most of the time, Windows would be able to recognize a device and will install drivers automatically. Some cases would require installing generic drivers. <br>
                Drivers – small software programs that help the operating system use the device. When a device is malfunctioning, one should ask whether the right driver has been installed.
                </p>
            <ol>
                <caption>There are several ways to install device drivers for your newly installed components:</caption>
                <li>
                        Manufacturer’s DVD Installer – Provided upon buying a computer, laptop, device

                <li>
                    Driverpack Solution – A free tool which automatically finds proper drivers for a computer, then downloads and installs it without wizards or installation prompts.

                </li>   
                <li>
                    Device Manager (Driver Update) – Can be accessed by clicking Start > Computer > Manage > Device Manager. From here, each component can have the option to install a driver through a CD or through searching automatically online.

            <h5>Checking Device Driver Installation</h5>
            <p>
                After installation, you would want to see if you've installed the correct device drivers to avoid any issues that may hinder the component from running in its full performance. <br>
                In this simple procedure, we are looking if there drivers are already installed. If the device driver is installed, updating it through the device manager would prompt to say that the drivers are installed.

            <p><strong>File System</strong> – A program used by the operating system to organize data or application files. The type of file system is used to determine how data and programs will be accessed. In addition to that, it can also control what data or programs will be available to users.</p>
            <ol>
                <caption><strong><u>Types of File System</u></strong></caption>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        FAT File System
                    </strong>
                    File Allocation Table Type allows the operating system to look for files on a disk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        FAT32 File System
                    </strong>
                    More advanced version of the FAT File System. It can partition size as well as access speed. Because of this, FAT32 allows users to have better disk space utilization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        ExFAT
                    </strong>
                    Stands for Extended File Allocation Table. A file system type that can be used for memory sticks and SD cards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        NTFS File System
                    </strong>
                    New Technology File System. Compared to FAT and FAT32, NTFS has a much bigger partition and file size. It is a highly reliable file system type because it is recoverable. It also has fault tolerance which means that logged transactions can be used to recover data.
